## Who we are
<img src="helm.jpg" align="left" width="150"/><br/>
Our club was founded in 2006 by several motor sports enthusiastic students. One year later, the first vehicle was completed. Since then, every year we build a functional race car and participate in international competitions. In the 15 years that our club has existed, we have implemented many changes and innovations. For example, we competed with a gasoline engine for the first 11 seasons and then decided to switch to the pioneering electric version. This season we made the switch to build a race car that drives autonomously.
